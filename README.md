# Salary Predictions of Data Professions
Welcome to the Salary Predictions of Data Professions project! This project aims to predict the salaries of data professionals based on various factors such as experience, job role, and performance ratings. The project includes data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning model development, and deployment of the predictive model as a web application.
# Project Structure
    • app.py: This file contains the Flask web application code for serving the predictive model and handling HTTP requests.
    • salary_prediction_pipeline_lr.pkl: This is the serialized machine learning model (e.g., trained with scikit-learn) used for predicting salaries.
    • static/: This directory contains static files such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files,  used for styling the web application.
    • templates/: This directory contains HTML templates used for rendering the web pages of the application.
# Getting Started
To run the Flask web application locally, follow these steps(make sure to have flask installed):
    1. Install Python 3.x on your machine if you haven't already.
    2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    3. Navigate to the project directory.
    4. Create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv
    5. Activate the virtual environment:
        ◦ On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
        ◦ On macOS and Linux: source venv/bin/activate
    6. Run the Flask application: python app.py
    7. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the application.
# Usage
    • Once the Flask application is running, you can use the web interface to input data for predicting salaries of data professionals.
    • Enter the required information such as job role, experience, age, and ratings, then click the "Predict" button to see the predicted salary.
    • The application will display the predicted salary based on the input provided.
